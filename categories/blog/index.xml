These locks were designed exclusively for self-storage facilities and have been the industry standard since their introduction. Bolt cutters cannot be used to remove disc locks because the hasp (or the U-shaped component of a padlock) cannot be accessed from the inside. A disc lock cannot be broken apart with a hammer, unlike a padlock or a keyless lock, which may be done with a hammer.
