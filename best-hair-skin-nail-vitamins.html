Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</i></p><p>Reviewed by<strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Dr. Diana Rangaves, PharmD</a></strong></p><p>Sometimes your body doesn’t quite have all it needs to give you the strong and healthy hair, skin and nails of your dreams. You can support it with supplements designed specifically to target your appearance. To help you find the right ones, we’ve curated a list of the best hair, skin and nail vitamins of 2024.</p><h2><strong>What Do Hair, Skin and Nail Vitamins Do?</strong></h2><p>Your body is supposed to naturally have all the nutrients needed to care for your hair, skin and nails. In reality, it’s easy to develop a nutrient deficiency without immediately noticing the effects. This is because our modern-day diets often contain fewer nutrients than our bodies require.</p><p>Without the nutrients needed to support natural regeneration, growth, turnover and other facets of hair, skin and nail health, your appearance may suffer. Hair, skin and nail vitamins contain nutrients that specifically target these areas. These include biotin, which is known for increasing the density of hair and boosting growth, fish oil to fight inflammation and reduce sun damage, vitamin A to treat acne, and vitamin C to fight free-radical damage. vitamins won’t replace healthy diet, but they can support and balance your nutrient intake so you’re getting all the vitamins and minerals your body needs. If your levels of certain nutrients are low and you take supplements, you should start to notice an improvement in your appearance.</p><h2><strong>Who Should Take Hair, Skin and Nail Vitamins?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Those who will benefit the most from hair, skin and nail vitamins are people with vitamin deficiencies. If you don’t think you eat a balanced diet or have other symptoms of vitamin deficiency, it’s worth consulting your physician. They can run tests to determine which micronutrients you need to supplement your diet. If you already take a multivitamin, you may want to compare the ingredients with some of these hair, skin and nail vitamins and consider switching to them. Most contain nutrients that are helpful for other body processes, along with ingredients that specifically target your hair, skin and nails.</p><h2><strong>What to Look For in a Hair, Skin and Nail Vitamin</strong></h2><p>There are a few things you should look for when choosing a hair, skin and nail vitamin:</p><ul><li aria-level=1><strong>Biotin</strong>. Biotin, a B-complex vitamin, is important for the way energy is created in your body. People with biotin deficiencies often experience hair loss and skin rashes, which is why taking biotin may help spur hair growth and improve skin health.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Folic Acid</strong>. This is a form of vitamin B9, which the body uses to create proteins and manage DNA and red blood cells. Because this vitamin is essential to the cells in your hair, some believe it’s an important hair growth nutrient.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Vitamin A</strong>. Vitamin A is essential for proper skin function, and assists in your body’s cell growth and immune processes. In a supplement, it serves as an antioxidant to combat free-radical damage and works wonders on acne-prone skin.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Vitamin D</strong>. Many people experience a lack of vitamin D during the winter, as sun exposure is necessary for vitamin D to be produced in the skin. In a supplement, vitamin D can stop hair loss and nail chipping.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Collagen</strong>. Collagen supplements have become popular in recent years, especially among celebrities who praise their anti-aging effects. These effects are backed up by studies that show taking regular collagen supplements improves the skin’s moisture levels and firmness while making wrinkles less noticeable. They have a minimal effect on nails and hair, though.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Saw Palmetto</strong>. Saw palmetto is an ingredient that offers natural protection from hair loss caused by DHT, an androgen hormone both men and women produce (although men have much higher levels). Saw palmetto may reduce hair loss by preventing the body from converting hormones into DHT.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>A Reputable Brand</strong>. It’s important to use products created by reputable brands. Is the brand offering the supplement recommended by physicians? Does the product get positive reviews? Is the brand one you recognize or that has been around for a while? These are important questions to ask yourself as you choose a vitamin.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Third-Party Testing</strong>. Looking for products that a third party has tested is a great way to ensure efficacy and safety.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>How the Ingredients Fit You</strong>. Most importantly, the supplement should contain ingredients that fit you. You may need to avoid certain ingredients if you’re pregnant or nursing, for example, or may be taking a medication that interacts badly with a specific ingredient. If you take more than one supplement, compare the labels to ensure you’re not getting an overdose of a vitamin or mineral. To understand what fits you best, speak with your doctor.</li></ul><h3><strong>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Hair & Skin Gummies</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image8-7.png alt="Blu Atlas Hair & Skin Gummies" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>These gummies from Blu Atlas top our list of the best hair, skin and nail vitamins of 2024.
